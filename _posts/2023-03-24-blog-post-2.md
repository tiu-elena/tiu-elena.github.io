Nowadays, neural networks attract an increased attention of the research community due to their ability to work with unconventional data types such as text, image, video or graph data. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models that can be used to analyze graph-structured data. Graph data is popular in such domains as social network analysis, fraud detection or drug discovery. GNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. However, the interpretability of GNNs has been a challenge, as they can be considered black-box models similarly to other neural networks.

In this blogpost, we explore the challenges of explainability in GNNs and the efforts made to make them more interpretable using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
