I am a second-year PhD researcher at the Research Center for Information Systems Engineering (LIRIS) at KU Leuven university, Belgium. My research is focused at the applications of machine learning and deep learning models for solving real business and academic problems. In particular, I am working on the case studies in anomaly detection for different domains and inductries. Anomaly detection provides critical and actionable information in a wide variety of applications. The techniques to detect anomalies range from straightforward manual expert observation to complex models such as decision trees and neural networks. The types of data containing anomalies vary greatly as well, with graph data attracting more and more attention in recent years. Moreover, it is key to understand not only what is predicted as anomaly but also why it is predicted making explainability of the model an important characteristic to consider.
