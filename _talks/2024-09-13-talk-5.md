Abstract: Advances in technology and its adoption in education have created opportunities for collecting and analyzing educational data. To complete the learning analytics lifecycle, the results of data analysis should be communicated to relevant stakeholders, who often lack expertise in analytics. Therefore, effective visualizations are essential for practical adoption. These visualizations are typically consolidated into a comprehensive display known as a Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD). This paper presents such a LAD that offers interactive representations of key learning indicators derived from learning management system log data. Furthermore, the LAD is firmly rooted in instructional design theory, with the goal of assisting educators in designing and refining their courses while facilitating instructional design tasks. Evaluation of the LAD, conducted through interviews with instructors, has demonstrated its utility in supporting the tasks of determining strategy, allocating time, and selecting resources.
