I am a data scientist with 4+ years of experience specialising in the applications of machine learning (ML), deep learning, and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to solve complex, real-world problems using both structured and unstructured data. My experience spans a wide range of international projects, where I have developed not only technical expertise such as advanced coding, algorithm design, and statistical analysis, but also strong communication, collaboration, and leadership skills. I have a research-driven mindset, which has resulted in several scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.
